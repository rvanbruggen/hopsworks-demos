# Welcome to my Hopsworks Demos repository
Here is where I will be sharing my work on Hopsworks demos and tests that could be of interest.

## Beer consumption prediction
In this demo we will try to predict the beer volume consumption of a particular beer in a particular bar.

The demo will have 3 parts:
1. Feature engineering pipeline
2. Training pipeline
3. Inferencing pipeline

Given the differences between environments, there is going to be a specific demo for Colab+Hopsworks Serverless, and another demo for Jupyter+Hopsworks Enterprise. 

Because of the supthe differences in environments, you will find 3 versions of this demo in this repo:
1. [Hopsworks app](https://app.hopsworks.ai) + [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) based.
2. [Hopsworks app](https://app.hopsworks.ai) + local python environment running from Visual Studio
3. [Hopsworks cluster](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) + local python environment running from Visual Studio

Currently, my recommendation would be to use 2, as I have sometimes encountered minor errors in the other two environments. All fixable, but still.
