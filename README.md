# Welcome to my Hopsworks Demos repository
Here is where I will be sharing my work on Hopsworks demos and tests that could be of interest.

## Beer consumption prediction
In this demo we will try to predict the beer volume consumption of a particular beer in a particular bar. The demo will have 3 parts:
1. Feature engineering pipeline
2. Training pipeline
3. Inferencing pipeline

Given the differences between environments, there is going to be a specific demo for Colab+Hopsworks Serverless, and another demo for Jupyter+Hopsworks Enterprise.
